# "Run the App" Exercise

## Learning Objectives

In this exercise, we'll learn how to install, configure, and run an existing Python application. We'll focus on environment management, package management, and setting environment variables.

## Prerequisites

  1. Complete the [Hello World (Local) Exercise](/exercises/hello-world/version-control.md) or [Hello World (Version Control) Exercise](/exercises/hello-world/version-control.md), as instructed by the professor. The goal is to have familiarity with local dev tools like the command line, a text editor, and a Git utility like GitHub Desktop.
  2. Read up about [Environment Variables](/notes/environment-variables/README.md) generally, focusing on their benefits. Don't worry about the sections describing how to set and get them - we will put that into practice in this exercise.


## Instructions

There are different versions of this exercise, each with varying levels of difficulty. Choose one as instructed by the professor:

  + [My First Python App](my-first-python-app.md)
  + [Daily Briefings App](daily-briefings.md)
  + [Tic Tac Toe App](tic-tac-toe.md) -- RECOMMENDED IN 2022
