# "API Client" Project - Implementation

> See: [The "API Client" Project](README.md)

## Instructions

  1. Search the Internet for one or more APIs or open data sources you are interested in.
  2. Investigate your ability to write Python to request and process the data.
  3. After demonstrating your ability to use the API, package up your code into a single reusable function (like the Stocks Dashboard and Weather App).
  4. Provide a single cell at the bottom which will capture user inputs as necessary, and invoke the function to produce the desired outputs.

### Data Requirements

Your app should fetch data from an API or other open data set / web page.

### Function Requirements

Your function should ideally be documented using a "docstring". It should specify what parameters it accepts (if any), and some example parameter values.

### Security Requirements

If your program requires sensitive information like secret passwords, API keys, or other credentials, those secret values should absolutely not be included in the source code.

If working in Colab, use `getpass` to prompt the user for their API key(s).

## Submission Instructions

Submit the designated Google Form before the designated date, providing the URL to your Colab Notebook.

## Evaluation

Project implementations will be evaluated according to the requirements set forth above, as summarized by the rubric below:

Category | Requirement | Weight
--- | --- | ---
API Usage | Processes data from an API or other open data source. | 20%
Function Usage | Performs the data processing from within a reusable function. | 20%
API Documentation | Provides links to the API documentation, and instructions for how someone can obtain an API key (as necessary). | 10%
Uniqueness and Individuality | Exhibits creativity, and a unique set of functionality. | 20%
User Experience | Provides a simple, pleasant, and intuitive experience for the user, without "bugs" or errors. | 15%
Security | Excludes sensitive information and credentials from the source code, and protects user data (as necessary). | 15%

This rubric is tentative, and may be subject to slight adjustments during the grading process.
