# Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) enables the remote development and execution of Python programs in the cloud, instead of on your local computer.

A colab document is essentially a Python notebook in Google Drive. Python notebooks use a mix of "code cells" and "text cells" to produce outputs helpful for instructional and presentation purposes.

Here are more essential resources for learning how to use Colab:

## Colab Notebooks vs Local Development

Colab is a ground-breaking new tool, but still has limitations, primarily in the areas of security, flexibility, and reproducibility. 

Colab Notebook Advantages:
  + Minimal learning curve
  + High degree of visibility and shareability
  + Effective presentation when code mixed with markdown and data visualizations
  + Potential for GPU / TPU processing power

Colab Notebook Disadvantages:
  + Can only write and execute Python code, not other languages
  + Harder to secure credentials and environment variables
  + Minimal processing power and parallel processing capabilities by default (excluding GPU / TPU)
  + Relatively low degree of customization
  + Unable to run certain kinds of apps, like web apps written in the Flask framework

Local Development Advantages:
  + Can write and execute code written in many different languages and frameworks
  + Greater ability to secure credentials and environment variables
  + Greater degree of customization / control
  + Greater privacy (not managed by Google)
  + More processing power and parallel processing capabilities (excluding GPU / TPU)

Local Development Disadvantages:
  + Steeper learning curve, likely many tools to learn
  + Not as easily shareable, unless pushing code to GitHub or a remote server
